# .bash_aliases

Ever wanted to shorten down a long or tedious command? Try using bash aliases. You simply write the command you want to create a shortcut for, and also gives the shortcut/alias command.

If the .bash_aliases doesn't already exist you can simply create it, and in most cases it starts working next time you start your shell. However, if that doesn't work you might have to specify it in your .bashrc file (guide coming soon).
